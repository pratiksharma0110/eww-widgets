;polls
;i think i should use cronjob to exectute this at midnight only instead of every 1s
(defpoll day :interval "1s"
  "date +'%A' | tr 'a-z' 'A-Z' "
  )
(defpoll cal :interval "1s" 
  "cal |sed '1d'"
  )

(deflisten calendar :initial '{ "year": "2025", "month": "", "dates": [], "current_date": "1", "day": ""}' 
  "scripts/calendar.sh")

;dont need calendar.sh to fetch days and all, for year and month, can use EWW_TIME too
